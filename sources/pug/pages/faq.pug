                  p We are in an age of specialization. As times have changed, no attorney can possibly keep up with all areas and complexities of the law, and that is why our team is comprised of the top legal minds, each with their own area of practice. Our firm is also unique in that while we all specialize in various aspects.

It may not be possible, or advantageous, to have one attorney handle all of your legal matters. One lawyer will be responsible for the overall progress of the case, but from time to time, another attorney may perform certain duties within the case itself. Please do not be concerned if your case is handled by a different attorney within our firm, as ‘your attorney’ will still be your attorney. This is merely another sign to you that we are doing our best to handle your case as professionally and efficiently as possible.
